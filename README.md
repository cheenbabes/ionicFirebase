## Overview

This project shows a sample Ionic Firebase app with fully working authentication and data persistence.


## Why Firebase

Firebase is basically backend as a service. It allows the developer to quickly build CRUD apps and seamlessly integrate authentication.

## Installation
For Mac/Linux, you may need to run these commands with `sudo`. On Windows, make sure you running your prompt as Administrator.
Requires node and npm.

```
    npm install
    bower install
```
Sign up for a Firebase account (it's free) and add your URL to line 40 of app.js

```
    ionic serve --lab
```

You should see a browser pop up at port 8081.
For running on Android, make sure you have all the necessary libraries and SDKs, then run `ionic run android` with your phone plugged in and it should work.


## Limitations

There's a known bug with routing after authentication. This just needs to be fixed with some custom code in `app.js`. Please fork and contribute.
